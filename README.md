# Battle-Balloons
Blinks tabletop game

You are captain of a hot air balloon fleet, trying to pop your opponent's King Balloon to emerge victorious from battle.

Setup Phase -
1. Once all Blinks learn the game, divide balloons/Blinks evenly among 2 players
2. Single click to cycle between Red/Large, Blue/Medium, Green/Small
  a) For even fair play, make sure each player has the same number of each color  
  b) to give one player an advantage, allow them to have more larger balloons
4. 3x click (any multiclick) at any point in the game restarts the game by going back to Setup Phase and re-randomizes balloon health
5. Long press one 

Balloons pop (balloon health = 0) after X clicks that are equally likely:
  Red/Large 3,4,5, or 6 
  Blue/Medium 2,3, or 4
  Green/Small 1 or 2
