# Battle-Balloons
for 6+ Blinks 
for 2+ players 
  standard game is for 2 players because any more players could end up in ganging up on one unfortunate player

You are captain of a hot air balloon fleet, trying to pop your opponent's King Balloon to emerge from battle victorious.  Navigate the airs of random chance and rely on strategic trickery to pop before you yourself are popped.

In English, the goal of the game is to pop the balloon/Blink your opponent designated as King before they pop the balloon/Blink you selected as your King.  Players take turns clicking their opponent's balloons to reduce balloon health and eventually pop them.

::Gameplay::

SETUP Phase -

1. Once all Blinks learn the game, divide balloons/Blinks evenly among 2 players
2. Single click to cycle between Red/Large, Blue/Medium, Green/Small
  a) For even fair play, make sure each player has the same number of each color  
  b) To give one player an advantage, allow them to have more larger balloons
3. Once you have your colors selected, 3x click (any multiclick) to randomize balloon health
  a) At any point in the game restarts the game by going back to Setup Phase and re-randomizes balloon health
4. Each player long presses one of their balloons/Blinks to set it as their King Balloon
  a) Hide your selection from your opponent ;^) - this step is the strategic trickery
  b) King Balloon shows as yellow until PLAY phase
5. 2x click one balloon/Blink on each player's cluster to move to PLAY phase 

PLAY Phase - 

6. Players take turns clicking their opponent's balloons until they pop
  a) Balloons are dark when popped
  b) Balloon health is shown by face counters 
7. Player who pops their opponent's King Balloon wins!
  a) Balloon/Blink turns white and others in cluster turn purple when King is popped
8. 3x click a Blink in each cluster to return to SETUP phase
  
::Strategy::

It might seem obvious to always select a Red balloon as your king since they take the longest to pop.  Your opponent knows this too so they may start clicking the Red balloon first.  If I know you think I should select a Red king, then selecting a Blue as king could make you waste 3-6 clicks popping a non-king Red balloon.  Let the game theory begin!

::Balloon Popping::

Balloons "pop" after X clicks that are equally likely to be randomly selected.  For example, there's a 25% chance a Red balloon pops after 5 clicks and a 50% chance a Blue balloon pops after 2 clicks.
  Red/Large 3, 4, 5, or 6 
  Blue/Medium 2, 3, or 4
  Green/Small 1 or 2
  /* I'm considering reducing the scale of this so less clicks are required to pop each balloon
