# Battle-Balloons
for 6+ Blinks 
</br>for 2+ players 
</br>  standard game is for 2 players because any more players could end up in ganging up on one unfortunate player

You are captain of a hot air balloon fleet, trying to pop your opponent's Crown Balloon to emerge from battle victorious.  Navigate the airs of random chance and rely on strategic trickery to pop before you yourself are popped.

More simply, the goal of the game is to pop the Balloon/Blink your opponent designated as Crown before they pop the Balloon/Blink you selected as your Crown.  Players take turns clicking their opponent's balloons to reduce balloon health and eventually pop them.  Watch out for the trap Bust Balloon!  Popping the Bust will cause you to lose immediately.  

## ::Gameplay::
### SETUP Phase
1) *Teach Game*: Once all Blinks learn the game, divide balloons/Blinks evenly among 2 players
2) *Assign Colors*: **Single click** to cycle between ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)Red/Large, ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)Blue/Medium, ![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+)Green/Small
  </br> a) For even fair play, make sure each player has the same number of each color
  </br> b) To give one player an advantage, allow them to have more larger balloons
3) *Select King/Queen or Bomb Balloon*: Each player **long presses** one or more of their Balloons/Blinks to set it as their King Balloon
  </br> a) Hide your selection from your opponent ;^) - this step is the strategic trickery
  </br> b) King Balloon shows as yellow until PLAY phase
4) *Begin PLAY*: **3x click** one balloon/Blink on each player's cluster to move to PLAY phase 

### PLAY Phase - 3x click
5) *Start Popping*: Players take one of two actions during their turn.
  </br> a) Attack - Click an opponent's Balloon to reduce health, shown by # faces lit (-1)
  </br> b) Fortify - Transfer health from one of your Balloons to another (+1)
6) *Win*: Player who pops their opponent's King Balloon wins!
  </br> a) Crown Balloon/Blink turns white/yellow and others in cluster spin purple when Crown is popped
6.5) *Lose*: Player who pops their opponent's Bust Balloon loses!
  </br> a) Bust Balloon/Blink turns white/orange and others in cluster spin purple when Bust is popped
7) *Play Again*: **2x click** a Blink in each connected cluster to return to SETUP phase
  </br> a) At any point in the game, **2x click** restarts the game by going back to Setup Phase and re-randomizes balloon health
  
## ::Strategy::
It might seem obvious to always select a Red balloon as your king since they take the longest to pop.  Your opponent knows this too so they may start clicking the Red balloon first.  If I know you think I should select a Red king, then selecting a Blue as king could make you waste 3-6 clicks popping a non-king Red balloon.  Let the game theory begin!

## ::Balloon Popping::
Balloons "pop" after X clicks that are equally likely to be randomly selected depending on Balloon color.  For example, there's a 25% chance a Red balloon pops in 5 clicks, a 33% change a Blue Balloon pops in 3 clicks, and a 50% chance a Green Balloon pops in 2 clicks.
  </br>![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Red/Large 3, 4, 5, or 6 
  </br>![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Blue/Medium 2, 3, or 4
  </br>![#c5f015](https://via.placeholder.com/15/c5f015/000000?text=+) Green/Small 1 or 2
 
## ::Balloon Fortification::
1. A Balloon must have at least one health bar left to become a giver (must have more than 0)
2. A Balloon cannot have full health to be a receiver (must have have less than 6)
3. Remove one Balloon from the cluster - this will be the giver
4. Re-join it to your cluster placing the white face against the Balloon you want to receive +1 health
5. End turn
